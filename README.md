[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xd009642/zxcvbn-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xd009642/zxcvbn-rs)

This is a Rust port of [`zxcvbn`](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) a password strength checker which is based on how password crackers work. This is currently a work in progress to learn the Rust programming language but will hopefully be functional in the near future.
